# ASTRONAUT

ASTRONAUT provides users with computer-readable data for minor objects in the solar system. This database contains normalized thermal emission flux data collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in the frequency bands 90, 150, and 220 GHz across three separate ACT arrays. Additionally, the database contains time (unix) of observations, flux error bars, and weighting factors used to normalize the flux. These data are based on the paper by [Orlowski-Scherer et al. (2024)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad21fe/meta).

## Example Queries
- `s3://cornell-acteroids/Bamberga_lc_pa6_150.fits`
- `s3://cornell-acteroids/Bamberga_lc_pa5_150.fits`
- `s3://cornell-acteroids/Vesta_lc_pa4_220.fits`

## Query Parameters

The general form for making a query to the S3 path is `s3://cornell-acteroids/name_lc_arr_freq.fits`. The following queries are required:

| Parameter | Type      | Arguments     | Description
| --------- |:---------:|:---------:    |---------:
| name      | str       |               | name of minor object in the database
| arr       | str       | pa4, pa5, pa6 | ACT array
| freq      | str       | 090, 150, 220 | frequency (GHz) of observation

## Data Output

A valid request to ASTRONAUT will return one of the following:
- `FITS` data file for the request
- an error indicating an invalid request

## lookup.md

The `lookup.md` file describes how to use the `ast_ftns.py` script to look for minor objects in the API, as well as which frequency and array combinations are supported. The file also provides example output from example calls to the script.
